Welcome to this repository, where I share my experience of learning HTML and CSS. In this README, I'll talk about how I went about it, the difficulties I faced, and how I tackled them while working on a web development project.



                                                                Things that  i Learnt While Building This Project

1. Making Pages Fit Different Screens
    One of my initial struggles was making my web pages look good on all devices. I had a hard time with CSS media queries and responsive design. To overcome this, I spent time        learning about responsive design principles and practiced creating layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
   
2. Layouts and Positioning
    Positioning elements on the page, especially for complex layouts, was tricky. I tackled this by diving into CSS Flexbox and Grid. I practiced using these layout tools until I      felt confident using them in my projects.
   
3. Debugging Issues
   Running into bugs and issues was part of the process, but learning how to effectively debug was crucial. I picked up skills like using browser developer tools, adding              console.log statements, and leveraging online resources to identify and fix issues efficiently.


   OverAll it was an AMAZING experience.
